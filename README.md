Welcome to the code repisitory of the duplicate detection algorithm for the course Computer Science for Business Analytics (FEM21037). The code can be used as followed. In main.py you can import your data and configure all the parameters which will be used in the duplcation detection. The code in main.py will go over a multiple of methods which can be found in classes.py, here the meat and bones of the code can be found. Lastly there is oldCodes.py, this the scrapyard of old classes which in the end I did not use or took apart and created a working variant of which can be found in classes.py.
